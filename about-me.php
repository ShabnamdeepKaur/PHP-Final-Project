            <p>
                Hello, My name is Shabnamdeep Kaur. I am a student at Georgian College, Barrie. I am from India. I love
                Shakespeare's
                plays a lot. I cherish to spend my leisure time with my parents and friends. I am trying to learn
                Canadian accent of
                English. I always try to make friends whom my mother may like but unfortunately I am never successful in
                that matter üòù.
                I love living in the nature.
